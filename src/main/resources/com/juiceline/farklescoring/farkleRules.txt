* Other numbers count if you get three or more of the same number in a single roll.
* Other combinations of numbers are worth points if you get them in a single roll.

Note: Dice from multiple rolls cannot be added together.
For example, if you set aside one 5(50 points) 
on you first roll and two 5s(100 points) on your second role, you have 150 points.
You cannot add them together to make three 5s (500 points).
* Some scoring dice must be removed after every role.

Set up:
* Pick on player to be the score keeper.
* All players roll one Die.  Whoever has the highest roll goes first with 
play passing to the left.
* After each roll, set aside Dice that are worth points and 
roll the res of them.  You must remove at least on e Die after each roll and
keep a running total of your points of that turn.
* If you re lucky enough to set aside all six Dice, you can roll 
them all again to build your running total.
* if you cannot set aside any Dice after a roll, that's a Farkle.
You lose yor running total of points for that turn and play passes the the left.
A Farkle could happen on your first roll or when you roll the remaining Dice.
* To get on the score Pad for the first time. you must have a running
total of 500 points before you stop rolling.
* After your first score of 500 points or more is recorded, you may 
stop rolling at any time and have the scorekeeper add you running total
for that turn to your accumulated score.  Once your points are entered on 
the Score Pad, they are safe, and you cannot lose them.

Winning: When a player's accumulated score is 10,000 or more, each of the other
players has one last turn to beat the total.  The player with the highest 
score wins.
